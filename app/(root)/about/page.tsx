          I am a motivated Web Developer with a double major in Computer Science
          and Graphic Design, uniquely blending technical expertise with
          creative vision. Proficient in a wide range of programming languages,
          frameworks, and Adobe Creative Suite tools, I thrive at the
          intersection of design and development. With a passion for clean
          design, intuitive user experiences, and functional, efficient code, I
          enjoy building and deploying responsive, high-performance websites and
          web applications. I bring a high level of organization, attention to
          detail, and problem-solving ability to every project, always striving
          to deliver polished, user-focused solutions. Whether collaborating on
          a team or leading a project, Iâ€™m driven by curiosity, continuous
          learning, and a commitment to excellence.
